    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p></p>
    <p>This salsa chicken recipe is very easy and quick! Someone gave me this recipe a few years back, and it has become a household favorite. Depending on your taste, you can use mild, medium, or hot salsa. I usually serve it with Spanish rice and Mexican-style canned corn.</p>
